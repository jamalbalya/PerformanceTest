# PerformanceTest
Performance Test Using Python


In this code, you would replace the my_function function with the function you want to performance test. 
The num_runs variable specifies the number of times to run the function. The timeit.timeit() function runs the specified function num_runs times and returns the total time taken to run all the runs. 
The average_time variable calculates the average time taken to run the function per run. Finally, the code prints the average run time.

Note that the timeit module is designed to measure the performance of small code snippets, so it may not be appropriate for testing the performance of larger programs or complex functions. 
In such cases, you may need to use other profiling tools and techniques to identify performance bottlenecks.
